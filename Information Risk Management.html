							<h3>UNIT 1</h3>
							<h4>DISCUSSION 1: Initial Post</h4>

<p>
My initial post was focused on  Spears & Barki’s study on the influence of users in the risk management process. Their study used qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods to interview users from different backgrounds, develop a questionnaire survey and then measure and correlate the collected data. The result of the study revealed that qualitative and quantitative methods provided a wealth of adequate and relevant information.
The study also showed many substantial advantages with user’s involvement in risk management process such as: increased awareness and accountability, development of remediation plans for failed controls, communication of policies and procedures to peers and staff and enforcement of access controls and segregation of duties.
Without user’s participation in the risk management process, the required data would have to be sourced using hypotheses and scenarios which may not provide an accurate representation of the risk.

<h4>DISCUSSION 2: Initial Post</h4>
<p> 
My initial post was focused on the top 5 causes of risks. After reviewing Hijazi et al. (2014) and Roy et al (2015) studies on risk factors, I selected the top 5 risk factors that can impact the software development process and cause significant risks. I also identified the appropriate mitigations factors that can be implemented to reduce or neutralize the impact of risks. The top 5 risk factors selected are: 
</p>
<p> 1- Continuous changing requirements </p>
<p>  Mitigation </p>
<p>  - Plan for the introduction of new requirements during the planning stage of the project. </p>
<p>  - Adjust project timeline as required. </p>
<p>  - Provision of additional funding and resources. </p>
<p>  - Assessment of risk analysis of changes. </p>
<p>  - Ensure the project stages and tasks (code) are well documented so changes can be easily introduced. </p>
<p>  - Automation and flexibility of test scenarios to facilitate new requirements. </p>
<p>  - Ensure stakeholders are briefed on the costs, schedules and impact of the new requirements and they are in agreement with the changes. </p>
<p>   - Develop a requirements traceability matrix to track new requirements and changes. </p>
<p>  - Create automated testing. </p>
</p>
<p> 2- Budget and Project Funding Loss </p>
<p>  Mitigation </p>
<p>   - Funds should be secured and available before the initial phase of the project. </p>
<p>   - Each phase of the project should be identified, and funding allocated. </p>
<p>   - Provision should be made to ensure that budget overrun is tackled at an early stage through monitoring and mapping of executed components and allocated funds. </p>
<p>   - Identify related costs for the project and plan the budget informed by those projected costs. </p>
<p>   - Allocate sufficient funds for new requirements and changes. </p>

<p> 3- Inadequate estimation of project time, cost, scope and other resources </p>
<p>  Mitigation </p>
<p>  -  Detail the description and availability of the system life cycle processes with sufficient time, funding, human, and material resources to ensure a complete application of the processes within a comprehensive system engineering effort.
<p>   -  Ensure Resources and budgets are allocated. </p>
<p>   - Identify and allocate resources for the project goals and objectives. </p>
<p>   - Identify and allocate training, education, or mentoring resources. </p>

<p> 4- Data loss and lack of sufficient security in the developed product </p>
<p>  Mitigation </p>
<p>  -  Integrate security requirements, functions, and services into the mainstream management and technical processes within the life cycle processes of systems and build trustworthy secure systems capable of protecting stakeholder assets. </p>
<p>  - The specific scope of security must be clearly defined by stakeholders in terms of the assets to which security applies and the consequences against which security is assessed. </p>
<p>  - Security requirements elicitation and analysis should be conducted to unambiguously and clearly ascertain the scope of security in terms of the assets to which security applies and the associated consequences or losses against which security is assessed. </p>
<p>  - The specific scope of security must be clearly defined by stakeholders in terms of the assets to which security applies and the consequences against which security is assessed. </p>
<p>  - Define the objectives, scope, level of fidelity, and level of assurance of the security aspects of system analysis. </p>

<p> 5- Missing capabilities and unsatisfied customer of the developed product. </p>
<p>  Mitigation </p>
<p> -  Assess whether the system meets baseline functional and performance capabilities. </p>
<p> - Define the stakeholder needs and requirements process for a system that can provide the capabilities needed by users and other stakeholders in a defined environment. </p>
<p> - Identify potential new or modified capabilities or aspects of missions or business opportunities. </p>
<p> - Define a representative set of scenarios to identify all required capabilities and measures that correspond to anticipated operational and other life cycle concepts. </p>
