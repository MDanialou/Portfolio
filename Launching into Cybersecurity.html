							<h3>Unit 1-3</h3>
							<h3>DISCUSSION1: Initial Post</h3>
My initial Post was focused on the acceleration of digitalization as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic. The acceleration has led many unprepared organisations to join the digital race by exposing their critical assets and data to the whole world without adequate security controls.
This situation has resulted in severe consequences to organisations as they bear the cost of breaches and damage to their reputation.
In response to my post, several of my peers provided some more insights into the lack of security controls and one stated that some sectors such as banking started the digitalisation of their services long before the pandemic to save money and make profits, which I agree with. 
Here is an excerpt of my initial post.
<p> As one of the nine pillars of technologies driving the 4th Industrial Revolution (BCG Middle East - EN, N.D.), Cybersecurity is a domain that requires special attention in this digital age.
“It is an evolving discipline which requires constant research to be able to keep up with upcoming threats as well as developing effective methods and approaches to match these threats.” (Forum W.E., N.D.)
From cryptocurrency to online shopping, the digitization of our society is rapidly expanding. This was further compounded by the Covid19 pandemic that forced even the most reluctant and ill-prepared businesses to join the digitization race or face a certain decline and collapse in revenue.
With vulnerable IoT devices interconnected with High Performance Computers and Industrial Control Systems in a global village of technologies, cybersecurity is not only a global issue but a vital necessity for the survival of businesses.
As more businesses are joining the digitization race in order to survive, cybersecurity has been left trailing behind with businesses ill-equipped to assess the risks of exposing critical business data and assets to a global audience without implementing adequate security controls. This issue is further exacerbated by the ever-changing threat landscape and the skill gap of an estimated 3 million cybersecurity professional worldwide ((ISC)2 Blog, N.D.)
</p>	
 
<p> Below is the summary of my post after discussions and feedback from my peers. </p>
<p> My initial posting was focused on the acceleration of the digital transformation worldwide due to the covid 19 pandemic and the increasing number of ill-prepared businesses joining the digitilisation race in order to survive. These businesses do not have the tools required to assess the risks of exposing their critical assets and data to a global audience without the required security controls. 
 In response to my post, Jubet (2021) pointed out that some businesses such as the ones in the financial sector accelerated their digital transformation to cut costs and boost profit. This is indeed true as many high street banks have moved their business online and closed hundreds of branches thus exposing customers to the perils of online banking. 
Another important point raised by Paintsil (2021) which I completely agree with, is the education and training of users at all levels. As the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain, a formal awareness training program to educate users on identifying and reporting cyber threats is a must. Training of workforce is critical to the safety of businesses and is an effective countermeasure since most breaches occur as a result of user's actions.
In Unit 2 and 3, we reviewed some important considerations to cybersecurity which organisations should consider to achieve a good cybersecurity posture: <p>
<p> •	Good security practices to generate, process and store data by ensuring data Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. </p>

<p> •	Good security measures to predict, protect, detect and response to security incidents with qualified workforce in formal roles. </p>

<p> •	Design of secure systems to ensure penetration and disruption are difficult and compromise is easy to detect. </p>

<p> •	The implementation of adequate security countermeasures to strengthen access to systems with a formal training program for users to detect and report cyberthreats. </p>

<p> •	The design of a secure network to prevent unauthorised access, misuse, modification, denial of service etc. </p>

<p> •	Adoption of a threat modelling technique to help identify threats that may impact systems. </p>

<p> •	Implementation of a secure design. </p>
