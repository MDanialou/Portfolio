							<h3>Unit 1-3</h3>
							<h3>DISCUSSION1: Initial Post</h3>
My initial Post was focused on the acceleration of digitalization as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic. The acceleration has led many unprepared organisations to join the digital race by exposing their critical assets and data to the whole world without adequate security controls.
This situation has resulted in severe consequences to organisations as they bear the cost of breaches and damage to their reputation.
In response to my post, several of my peers provided some more insights into the lack of security controls and one stated that some sectors such as banking started the digitalisation of their services long before the pandemic to save money and make profits, which I agree with. 
Here is an excerpt of my initial post.
<p> As one of the nine pillars of technologies driving the 4th Industrial Revolution (BCG Middle East - EN, N.D.), Cybersecurity is a domain that requires special attention in this digital age.
“It is an evolving discipline which requires constant research to be able to keep up with upcoming threats as well as developing effective methods and approaches to match these threats.” (Forum W.E., N.D.)
From cryptocurrency to online shopping, the digitization of our society is rapidly expanding. This was further compounded by the Covid19 pandemic that forced even the most reluctant and ill-prepared businesses to join the digitization race or face a certain decline and collapse in revenue.
With vulnerable IoT devices interconnected with High Performance Computers and Industrial Control Systems in a global village of technologies, cybersecurity is not only a global issue but a vital necessity for the survival of businesses.
As more businesses are joining the digitization race in order to survive, cybersecurity has been left trailing behind with businesses ill-equipped to assess the risks of exposing critical business data and assets to a global audience without implementing adequate security controls. This issue is further exacerbated by the ever-changing threat landscape and the skill gap of an estimated 3 million cybersecurity professional worldwide ((ISC)2 Blog, N.D.)

<p> Below is the summary of my post after discussions and feedback from my peers. </p>
<p> My initial posting was focused on the acceleration of the digital transformation worldwide due to the covid 19 pandemic and the increasing number of ill-prepared businesses joining the digitilisation race in order to survive. These businesses do not have the tools required to assess the risks of exposing their critical assets and data to a global audience without the required security controls. 
 In response to my post, Jubet (2021) pointed out that some businesses such as the ones in the financial sector accelerated their digital transformation to cut costs and boost profit. This is indeed true as many high street banks have moved their business online and closed hundreds of branches thus exposing customers to the perils of online banking. 
Another important point raised by Paintsil (2021) which I completely agree with, is the education and training of users at all levels. As the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain, a formal awareness training program to educate users on identifying and reporting cyber threats is a must. Training of workforce is critical to the safety of businesses and is an effective countermeasure since most breaches occur as a result of user's actions.
In Unit 2 and 3, we reviewed some important considerations to cybersecurity which organisations should consider to achieve a good cybersecurity posture: <p>
<p> •	Good security practices to generate, process and store data by ensuring data Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. </p>

<p> •	Good security measures to predict, protect, detect and response to security incidents with qualified workforce in formal roles. </p>

<p> •	Design of secure systems to ensure penetration and disruption are difficult and compromise is easy to detect. </p>

<p> •	The implementation of adequate security countermeasures to strengthen access to systems with a formal training program for users to detect and report cyberthreats. </p>

<p> •	The design of a secure network to prevent unauthorised access, misuse, modification, denial of service etc. </p>

<p> •	Adoption of a threat modelling technique to help identify threats that may impact systems. </p>

<p> •	Implementation of a secure design. </p>

							<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p> The subject of the discussion was very much interesting as it brought back memories of a presentation I gave at a cybersecurity awareness event a few years back on the importance of cybersecurity in the Digital age. I enjoyed reading about my peers' posting and their view on the subject. The feedback received from my peers and their insight of various aspects of cybersecurity have definitely enriched my knowledge and broadened my understanding of the subject.  </p>
							
							
							<h3>Unit 4-5</h3>
In these 2 units we focused on:
<p> -	The review of threat modelling techniques. </p>
<p> -	The implementation of security solutions. </p>
<p> -	UML concepts and principles to software analysis and design. </p>
<p> -	Exploration of the concepts, principles and techniques of programming. </p>
<p> -	Development of different types of UML diagrams using the Visual Paradigm tool. </p>


<p> UML diagrams
<p> The emphasis is on the practical application of UML diagrams in designing software that mitigates threats and vulnerabilities. Examples of UML diagrams are Class, Abuse, Sequence etc. </p>
<p> Class diagram: A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's: classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. </p>
<p> Use case Diagram: This diagram is used to capture the dynamic aspect of a system, gather the requirements of a system, get an outside view of a system, Identify the external and internal factors influencing the system, and show the interaction among the requirements are actors. </p>
<p> Sequence Diagram: Is an interaction diagram that details how operations are carried out -- what messages are sent and when. </p>

							<h3>Reflection</h3>
	
	<p> The UML diagrams were very interesting. There are very similare to network schematics using microsoft Visio. Although it was thew first time I was using Visual Paradigm, being able to design the various types of UML diagrams to show users interaction with systems and threats to applications and systems was very rewarding. All the different elements discussed in these units have helped to understand how systems are designed and secure. By using the UML diagrams, it is relatively simple to predict the threats that may affect a system from a design perspective. They also helped to prepare for the security controls that need to be implemented to secure the system and application. </p>


							<h3> Unit 6, 7, 8 </h3>
Focused on the practical application of UML diagrams in designing software that mitigates against threats and vulnerabilities.
The objective was to use the UML tool to design security requirements for software development, apply UML diagram to model software behaviour and model software data structures.
The main topic of these units was on the collaborative discussion whose objective is to identify and discuss two security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. The discussion could consider either network or/and software security issues. For example, if a network issue, what type of firewall would be ideal for the solution? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the solution?
You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). This is activity will provide evidence of your personal growth. It will be a component of the e-portfolio, which you can submit at the end of the module for feedback.
<p> 1.	Identify and explain the architecture, structure and functionality of basic components of a computer system, considering Cyber Security issues. </p>
<p> 2.	Evaluate critically implications of the key vulnerabilities and threats of software and network security and approaches to mitigate these issues. </p>
							
							<h3>DISCUSSION 2: Initial Post</h3>

My initial post identified 2 network security solutions that have changed the cybersecurity landscape. These are the Advanced Malware analysis Sandbox solution and the Next Generation Firewall (NGFW). The Advanced Malware analysis Sandbox solution has for instance enabled organisations to detect previously undetected advanced malware such as Advanced Presistemt Threats (APT). By moving detection from appearance of malware to behaviour, the Advanced Malware analysis Sandbox solution has provided organisations with a powerful and novel way to detect advanced malware and collect intelligence to profile their adversaries. 
The Next Generation Firewall has also taken the traditional packet filtering firewall to a new level by combining advanced features such as deep packet inspection with application control and user awareness to detect malware and safeguard organisation’s critical assets and data.
The following is an excerpt of the initial post.
The sophistication of cyber-attacks and their increased frequency have rendered traditional malware detection technologies which rely on signatures and known threats ineffective and helpless (Karantzas & Patsakis, 2021).

New technologies such as advanced malware analysis sandbox and Next Generation firewall (NGFW) have provided deep insight into malware behaviour against systems and applications and enabled organisations to detect unknown and zero-day malware by dynamically analysing and automating the malware analysis process to improve efficiency (FireEye, N.D.).
<p> The following is the summary post after discussion and feedback of my peers. </p>

The sophistication of cyber-attacks and their increased frequency have rendered traditional malware detection technologies ineffective and helpless (Karantzas and Patsakis, 2021).  Consequently, an effective malware detection can no longer be reliant on appearance alone.
My initial post focused on 2 technologies that are the advanced malware analysis sandbox and the Next Generation Firewall (NGFW).
The advanced malware analysis technology has enabled organisations to isolate and analyse malware in a safe and closed virtual environment, to inventory the behaviour of malware and gather well-needed intelligence. The technology has helped detect Advanced Persistent threats (APTs) which otherwise would have compromised organisations without their knowledge.  (FireEye, N.D.)
Liana (2021) has argued that there is no known method to defend against zero-day attacks which I could not agree with. This is because malware detection and defenses and particularly of zero-day attacks rely on a combination of effective security controls such as: secure architecture, network monitoring and defense, software assets inventory controls etc.. which many organisations are lacking.
I concur with Samuel (2022) on the malware analysis types and especially the dynamic analysis that allows activities of a suspicious file to be observed which shows the usefulness of sandbox technology.
The Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), ability to inspect traffic based on IPs and ports, to decrypt and perform deep packet analysis are unrivaled. Its advanced capabilities such as application awareness and user control (Check Point Software, N.D.) are critical to detecting advanced malware evasion techniques.
In conclusion, the advanced malware analysis sandbox and the Next Generation Firewall technologies have revolutionized malware detection and provided deep insight into malware behaviour. However, these technologies are not a remedy for all advanced cyber-threats (Mills & Legg, 2020). Additionally, their advanced capabilities may affect applications and user experience due to performance degradation and latency. Organisations must therefore decide where to implement them and the features that must be enabled to detect and mitigate advanced cyber-threats.
