							<h2>Module Objective</h2>
							<p>This module introduces the underpinning concepts and skills of Secure Software Development. It is designed to  help students acquire a critical understanding of the concept of abstraction in programming, develop an understanding of the basic principles of secure development methodologies, explore how to undertake analysis, program design, software construction and testing required for software development, demonstrate an understanding of the basic principles of architecture, as well as traditional and contemporary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, such as TOGAF and Agile, the ability to put into practice the techniques learned in a team environment, demonstrating how to deal with conflicts and how to make compromises, and be able to critically evaluate the effectiveness of the approaches, utilise the opportunity to reflect on and evaluate your own personal development.</p>
							<h2>Module Outcomes</h2>
<p> Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.</p>
<p> Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them. </p>
<p> Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a solution that meets the design brief and critically evaluate solutions that are produced. </p>
<p> Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation. </p>

							<h4>COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION 1: Initial Post</h4>
							
<p>
My initial post was focused on Security logging and monitoring is a vital part of an organization's network management and system administration. Logs indicate current status of a system and contain information that refers to different security events, which occur within the system. Logs are used for different purposes, such as recording user activities, track authentication attempts, and other security events (Söderström and Moradian, 2013).
As one of the OWASP Top 10 in 2021 (OWASP, 2021), Security logging and monitoring failures impact the ability of an organization to detect and combat breaches due to the lack of visibility into system and application operations.
Organizations that do not value the importance of logging and monitoring may have to face issues in case of a breach or incident due to absence of records and evidence, or lax data management practices, which may also lead to legal, contractual or regulatory non-compliance (Vasant and Saloni, 2017)
The following UML use case diagram describes the high level functions and scope of a system. It identifies the interactions between the system and its actors. The use cases and actors in use-case diagrams describe what the system does and how the actors use it. (IBM, 2017)
