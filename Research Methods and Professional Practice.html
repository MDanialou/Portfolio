							<h2>Module Objective</h2>
							<p>This module provides a practical foundation in research methods that enables students to conduct research in 
							practical settings.
							Its aims is to provide the student with a practical foundation in research methods that will enable them to conduct
							research in a practical setting. 
							The module covers various tools and techniques that the student, as a researcher, may need and allows for feedback 
							through cases and project tasks.  It also provides essential insight into the legal, social, ethical and professional issues 
							applicable to computing projects, as well as the relevant codes of practice and practices.</p>
							<h2>Module Outcome</h2>
							<p> This module will help students differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning and understand why ethics 
							are important and how they may relate to students area of research and professional practice. It appraises the professional, 
							legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals and the principles of academic investigation, 
							applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. It helps evaluate critically existing literature, research design 
							and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. It also helps produce and evaluate critically a research proposal 
							for the chosen topic.</p>
