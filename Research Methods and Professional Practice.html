<b> Reflective Piece on Computing Ethics </b>
<br>
	
This reflective piece is based on a computing professional employed by Randox Labs, a pharmaceutical company with research centers in the UK and the European
Union (EU).
<br>
For the purpose of developing its highly secretive drugs, and in an effort to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors, Randox Labs relies heavily on 
the collection and processing of large volumes of data from various sources including patient data collected from hospitals and specialized clinics across the 
European Union member countries and the UK. Although this data does not include the names of patients, it contains private information such as: age, gender, 
part of their addresses, health status, ailments, treatments received, DNA data etc. This data is stored in huge data lakes accessible by authorized personnel.
<br>
During an unannounced audit of Randox Labs conducted by an external auditing company, it was found that the Labs fell short of the computing ethics 
and its obligation to ensure data is processed as per the requirements mandated on data processors. Randox Labs may also be in violation of several 
legislations pertaining to health care data due to not having all the necessary provisions to deal with such confidential and restricted data. Moreover, 
it was found that some of the participating hospitals and clinics do not always obtain patient consents before sharing their records.
<br>
In their survey paper, titled "The Ethics of Computing: A Survey of the Computing-Oriented Literature" Stahl et al (2016) found a number of issues pertaining to 
the ethics of computing. These issues which vary from privacy to justice and online piracy are increasingly affecting our society because of the expansion of 
computing in our daily lives.
<br>
The following issues have been observed during the audit of Randox Labs.
<br>
<b> Privacy</b>: It was found that access to collected data was not restricted to authorized users. Data was shared with employees who were not authorized to 
view or receive it. Moreover, the Data Loss Prevention Program implemented by the company did not prevent the leakage of data.
As an important tenet of computing ethics, Privacy is a human right guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (Stahl et al, 2016). 
Therefore, data privacy should be a number one concern for Randox as the lack of technical controls such as non-encryption and non-randomization of data may 
lead to the identification of patients, their registered hospitals and physicians, their addresses etc. if leaked. The participating hospitals and clinics must also 
ensure the consent of patients is obtained for the use of their personnel and medical data and that the transfer of the data is done in a secure and safe way so 
that it does not fall into malicious hands.
<br>
Randox must ensure the following:
<li> Encryption of health data (in transit and at rest) to ensure they are protected from compromises (Stine, K. and Dang, Q. , 2011). </li>
<li> Scrubbing of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) by anonymizing or randomizing PII (Sweeney, N.D.). </li>
<li> Access control must be implemented to ensure data is only accessible by authorized users. </li>
<li> Consent must be obtained for data shared by medical providers. </li>
<li> A review of the Data Loss Prevention Program (Mwila, 2019) must be conducted to ensure its effectiveness. </li>
<li> Loss or theft of devices are investigated, and action taken to remove or wipe data. </li>
<li> Prevent the sharing of restricted data. </li>
<li> Prohibition of access of data from non-secure locations. </li>
<br>
<b>Consent</b>: The audit found that hospitals and clinics sharing patient data do not always seek patient consent before sharing their medical records. 
<br>
Patient consent is a very important issue that must be addressed. Patient medical records in most jurisdictions remain the property of the patient. 
Explicit patient consent must be sought for the sharing and distribution of their data outside of its intended use by the hospitals and the research 
center (Parliament.uk, 2015).
<br>
As a computing professional, there is a need to establish a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) function if it does not already exist to develop relevant 
policies pertaining to the collection and processing of patient health data. The policy will make it a requirement for data custodian to obtain explicit consent 
of patients before their data is shared and to prohibit the use of non-consented data. 
<br>
A Risk management team should also look at the various risks to the collected data, how it is processed, and the controls implemented to ensure the data is 
safeguarded. Lastly, a Compliance and legal team should be assembled to look at the relevant regulatory requirements from areas where data is being collected 
to ensure compliance with local data privacy and data protection regulations.
<br>
The following technical controls must be reviewed: encryption, anonymization, protection against phishing, authorization, process related to the loss or theft of 
devices, sharing of data, disposal of data, accessing data from non-secure locations.
<br>
<b>Trust</b>: The mishandling of patient data by Randox Labs may jeopardize the trust relation between medical providers and patients. 
Trust is a sacrosanct principle that is critical to the working dynamism between patients and healthcare providers. Consent in most cases will not be granted 
if trust is non-existent. As such, trust needs to be built over time to ensure patients have full confidence in their providers to use their data in the proper way 
as stated. Any deviation could have an irreversible impact on the working relation which may result in an indefinite damage. Therefore, safeguards and checkpoints 
should be implemented to validate controls periodically.
<br>
<b> Research ethics </b>: The audit found collected data is being used for purposes other than those consented by patients.
<br>
Collected patient data must be used only for the purpose for which it was collected. Using data to profile, discriminate or develop products that are targeted 
at certain demographic, ethnicities and races should be avoided and safeguards should be in place to ensure that this type of misuse and abuse of trust are avoided 
at all costs.
<br>
<b>Legal </b>: The audit found that Randox Labs may be in breach of data privacy regulations in the EU and the UK.
<br>
Legal issues are a big concern as long as patient medical records are being shared and distributed with 3rd parties. There are controls in the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the collection, transmission, processing and storage of health data (GDPR, 2018). In the US, the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) legislation provides robust boundaries in the handling of health data (HHS, 2013). In the UK, the Health and Care Act 2022 provides 
measures relating to the collection and sharing of health and care data (Legislation.gov.uk, 2022). There are also provisions to protect such data in the Data 
Protection Act 2018 (HM Government, 2018).
<br>
As a 3rd party trusted to process and handle restricted patient data, Randox Labs failed to uphold the high standard of computing ethics required to ensure medical 
providers and patients have full confidence in its ability to safeguard their data. The lack of encryption and access control show a lax approach to data protection.

<b>Unit 3: Research Methods</b>
<br>
<b> Main areas  </b>
<br>

<br>
- Introduce 3 research methods – quantitative, qualitative and mixed method research - as well as primary and secondary research methods, 
and the data collection methods associated with each one.	
<br>
<b> Seminar 2 Preparation </b>
For this exercise, I have selected Ransomware attacks as the topic.
The following articles have been chosen based on the research methods used.
<li> Ransomware against police: diagnosis of risk factors via application of cyber-routing activities theory (Choi et al, 2016).</li>
<li> Impact of trauma hospital ransomware attack on surgical residency training (Zhao et al, 2018).</li>
<br>	
In their research paper titled "Ransomware against police: diagnosis of risk factors via application of cyber-routing activities theory" Choi et al (2016) 
collected secondary data from social media and news outlets between 2013 and 2016 to analyze ransomware attacks against police departments in the US. 
The research method used is consistent with Quantitative research methodology which relies on the collection of data on which statistical analysis is 
then applied (Saunders & Thornhill 2012). 
<br>
By conducting a survey, the authors were able to collect data from 13 police departments. This data includes dates of reported cases, victim states, size of 
police department, ransom amount, ransom paid by the police and method of ransomware attacks to construct a victim profile and to identify what directly 
influenced the ransomware attacks (Choi et al, 2016). The analysis result which found the risk factor to be the online activities of users and the lax approach 
to cybersecurity are consistent with the current trend of ransomware infections and show a correlation between the attacks against the police departments and 
other well known attacks. 
<br>
The research methodology used in this paper is appropriate and addressed the purpose of the research. Moreover, it provided evidence through the data collected 
and statistics to show evidence of why the police departments were victims of the ransomware attacks.
<br>
However, the data collected could be expanded to cover other more critical areas and to include additional data such as cybersecurity hygiene and culture in the 
various departments with widespread awareness of the risk of ransomware attacks.
<br>
In the second paper titled “Impact of trauma hospital ransomware attack on surgical residency training” Zhao et al (2018), applied the mixed research case study 
methodology using interviews and questionnaire  to analyze the impact of ransomware attack on a hospital electronic health information system which led to the 
shutdown of the system for a few months. The author invited resident students to take part in the survey during the downtime of the system and then proceeded to 
collect the result by producing statistics that show the impact of the ransomware attacks on the residency training.
<br>
However, the surveys could have been expanded to show the root cause of the attack and provide recommendations to avoid this from occurring in the future.
<br>
In summary, both papers did provide answers to the questions and are consistent with the purpose of the research.
