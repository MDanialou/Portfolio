<b> Reflective Piece on Computing Ethics </b>
<br>
This reflective piece is based on a computing professional employed by Randox Labs, a pharmaceutical company with research centers in the UK and the European
Union (EU).
<br>
For the purpose of developing its highly secretive drugs, and in an effort to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors, Randox Labs relies heavily on 
the collection and processing of large volumes of data from various sources including patient data collected from hospitals and specialized clinics across the 
European Union member countries and the UK. Although this data does not include the names of patients, it contains private information such as: age, gender, 
part of their addresses, health status, ailments, treatments received, DNA data etc. This data is stored in huge data lakes accessible by authorized personnel.
<br>
During an unannounced audit of Randox Labs conducted by an external auditing company, it was found that the Labs fell short of the computing ethics 
and its obligation to ensure data is processed as per the requirements mandated on data processors. Randox Labs may also be in violation of several 
legislations pertaining to health care data due to not having all the necessary provisions to deal with such confidential and restricted data. Moreover, 
it was found that some of the participating hospitals and clinics do not always obtain patient consents before sharing their records.
<br>
In their survey paper, titled "The Ethics of Computing: A Survey of the Computing-Oriented Literature" Stahl et al (2016) found a number of issues pertaining to 
the ethics of computing. These issues which vary from privacy to justice and online piracy are increasingly affecting our society because of the expansion of 
computing in our daily lives.
<br>
The following issues have been observed during the audit of Randox Labs.
<br>
<b> Privacy</b>: It was found that access to collected data was not restricted to authorized users. Data was shared with employees who were not authorized to 
view or receive it. Moreover, the Data Loss Prevention Program implemented by the company did not prevent the leakage of data.
As an important tenet of computing ethics, Privacy is a human right guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (Stahl et al, 2016). 
Therefore, data privacy should be a number one concern for Randox as the lack of technical controls such as non-encryption and non-randomization of data may 
lead to the identification of patients, their registered hospitals and physicians, their addresses etc. if leaked. The participating hospitals and clinics must also 
ensure the consent of patients is obtained for the use of their personnel and medical data and that the transfer of the data is done in a secure and safe way so 
that it does not fall into malicious hands.
<br>
Randox must ensure the following:
<li> Encryption of health data (in transit and at rest) to ensure they are protected from compromises (Stine, K. and Dang, Q. , 2011). </li>
<li> Scrubbing of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) by anonymizing or randomizing PII (Sweeney, N.D.). </li>
<li> Access control must be implemented to ensure data is only accessible by authorized users. </li>
<li> Consent must be obtained for data shared by medical providers. </li>
<li> A review of the Data Loss Prevention Program (Mwila, 2019) must be conducted to ensure its effectiveness. </li>
<li> Loss or theft of devices are investigated, and action taken to remove or wipe data. </li>
<li> Prevent the sharing of restricted data. </li>
<li> Prohibition of access of data from non-secure locations. </li>
<br>
<b>Consent</b>: The audit found that hospitals and clinics sharing patient data do not always seek patient consent before sharing their medical records. 
<br>
Patient consent is a very important issue that must be addressed. Patient medical records in most jurisdictions remain the property of the patient. 
Explicit patient consent must be sought for the sharing and distribution of their data outside of its intended use by the hospitals and the research 
center (Parliament.uk, 2015).
<br>
As a computing professional, there is a need to establish a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) function if it does not already exist to develop relevant 
policies pertaining to the collection and processing of patient health data. The policy will make it a requirement for data custodian to obtain explicit consent 
of patients before their data is shared and to prohibit the use of non-consented data. 
<br>
A Risk management team should also look at the various risks to the collected data, how it is processed, and the controls implemented to ensure the data is 
safeguarded. Lastly, a Compliance and legal team should be assembled to look at the relevant regulatory requirements from areas where data is being collected 
to ensure compliance with local data privacy and data protection regulations.
<br>
The following technical controls must be reviewed: encryption, anonymization, protection against phishing, authorization, process related to the loss or theft of 
devices, sharing of data, disposal of data, accessing data from non-secure locations.
<br>
<b>Trust</b>: The mishandling of patient data by Randox Labs may jeopardize the trust relation between medical providers and patients. 
Trust is a sacrosanct principle that is critical to the working dynamism between patients and healthcare providers. Consent in most cases will not be granted 
if trust is non-existent. As such, trust needs to be built over time to ensure patients have full confidence in their providers to use their data in the proper way 
as stated. Any deviation could have an irreversible impact on the working relation which may result in an indefinite damage. Therefore, safeguards and checkpoints 
should be implemented to validate controls periodically.
<br>
<b> Research ethics </b>: The audit found collected data is being used for purposes other than those consented by patients.
<br>
Collected patient data must be used only for the purpose for which it was collected. Using data to profile, discriminate or develop products that are targeted 
at certain demographic, ethnicities and races should be avoided and safeguards should be in place to ensure that this type of misuse and abuse of trust are avoided 
at all costs.
<br>
<b>Legal </b>: The audit found that Randox Labs may be in breach of data privacy regulations in the EU and the UK.
<br>
Legal issues are a big concern as long as patient medical records are being shared and distributed with 3rd parties. There are controls in the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the collection, transmission, processing and storage of health data (GDPR, 2018). In the US, the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) legislation provides robust boundaries in the handling of health data (HHS, 2013). In the UK, the Health and Care Act 2022 provides 
measures relating to the collection and sharing of health and care data (Legislation.gov.uk, 2022). There are also provisions to protect such data in the Data 
Protection Act 2018 (HM Government, 2018).
<br>
As a 3rd party trusted to process and handle restricted patient data, Randox Labs failed to uphold the high standard of computing ethics required to ensure medical 
providers and patients have full confidence in its ability to safeguard their data. The lack of encryption and access control show a lax approach to data protection.

<b> Unit1 Reflection. </b>
<br>
As the first unit of this complex module, there was lot of reading to do to get familiar with the module as a whole. This module is not technical so it takes lot
of getting used to in order to complete the assignments.
There is also lot of information to digest and remember to work on the tasks. With time constraints, work and family commitments, it was a very tough
unit to get through. However, I have learned to prioritize and to work through the issues especially the understanding.

<b>Unit 3: Research Methods</b>
<br>

<b>Main areas</b>
<br>
<li>Introduce the concept of exploratory and descriptive research designs.</li>
<li>Introduce 3 research methods – quantitative, qualitative and mixed method research - as well as primary and secondary research methods, 
and the data collection methods associated with each one.</li>	
<br>

<b>Seminar 2 Preparation</b>
<br>
For this exercise, I have selected Ransomware attacks as the topic.
<br>
The following articles have been chosen based on their research methods.
<br>
<li>Ransomware against police: diagnosis of risk factors via application of cyber-routing activities theory (Choi et al, 2016).</li>
<li>Impact of trauma hospital ransomware attack on surgical residency training (Zhao et al, 2018).</li>
<br>	
In their research paper titled "Ransomware against police: diagnosis of risk factors via application of cyber-routing activities theory" Choi et al (2016) 
collected secondary data from social media and news outlets between 2013 and 2016 to analyze ransomware attacks against police departments in the US. 
<br>
The research method used is consistent with Quantitative research methodology which relies on the collection of data on which statistical analysis is 
then applied (Saunders & Thornhill 2012). 
<br>
By conducting a survey, the authors were able to collect data from 13 police departments. This data includes dates of reported cases, victim states, size of 
police department, ransom amount, ransom paid by the police and method of ransomware attacks to construct a victim profile and to identify what directly 
influenced the ransomware attacks (Choi et al, 2016). The analysis result which found the risk factor to be the online activities of users and the lax approach 
to cybersecurity are consistent with the current trend of ransomware infections and show a correlation between the attacks against the police departments and 
other well known attacks. 
<br>
The research methodology used in this paper is appropriate and addressed the purpose of the research. Moreover, it provided evidence through the data collected 
and statistics to show evidence of why the police departments were victims of the ransomware attacks.
<br>
However, the data collected could be expanded to cover other more critical areas and to include additional data such as cybersecurity hygiene and culture in the 
various departments with widespread awareness of the risk of ransomware attacks.
<br>
In the second paper titled “Impact of trauma hospital ransomware attack on surgical residency training” Zhao et al (2018), applied the mixed research case study 
methodology using interviews and questionnaire  to analyze the impact of ransomware attack on a hospital electronic health information system which led to the 
shutdown of the system for a few months. The author invited resident students to take part in the survey during the downtime of the system and then proceeded to 
collect the result by producing statistics that show the impact of the ransomware attacks on the residency training.
<br>
However, the surveys could have been expanded to show the root cause of the attack and provide recommendations to avoid this from occurring in the future.
<br>
In summary, both papers did provide answers to the questions and are consistent with the purpose of the research.

<b>Seminar 3 Preparation</b>
<br>
The objective of this exercise is to answer the questions below.
<br>
<b>The Case</b>
<br>
Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. 
For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.

Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to 
retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.
<br>
Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?
<br>
•	If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?
<br>
There are defined data protection roles assigned to entities interacting with data: Data subject, data controller, data processor and joint data protection 
officer etc. The following are some high-level definitions:
<br>
•	Subject: data subject
<br>
•	Controller: determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. be accountable, i.e., to take actions in line with GDPR, 
	and to be able to explain the compliance with GDPR to data subjects and the Supervisory Authority, as and when required.
<br>
•	Processor: A third party and legal entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller
<br>
•	Data Protection Officer (DPO): leadership role required by EU GDPR. This role exists within companies that process the personal data of EU citizens. 
	A DPO is responsible for overseeing the data protection approach, strategy, and its implementation. In short, the DPO is responsible for GDPR compliance
<br>
Q	Supervisory Authority: A Supervisory Authority is a public authority in an EU country responsible for monitoring compliance with GDPR.
<br>
R. As an IT technician who represents the data controller, Ricardo cannot share and give permission to a 3rd party without consulting first the DPO who will ensure 
compliance with the data protection controls which may require him/her to seek approval from the data subject. The DPO role is to ensure compliance with GDPR as the 
data being processed is personal data that contains private information. Article 6 of GDPR defines strict conditions for the processing of personal data (GDPR, 2018).
<br>
Q	Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access 
to Beth?
<br>
R: The main issue is the lack of consent from the data subject. The data controller needs to ensure approval is sought and granted by the data subject before sharing 
personal information with a 3rd party.
<br>
Q	Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are 
the ethical issues for the Records department to consider? 
The data subject only consented to the data controller, in this case HMRC. The data subject is not aware of the agreement between the data processor and the data 
controller. In order for the subject personal information to be shared with a 3rd party, the controller must seek the subject approval. As such Beth should not be 
allowed to contact the individuals involved and nor should the record department release individuals’ names to Beth as it would be a breach of privacy and confidentiality 
	of the data protection regulation.
<br>
Q	Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, 
	and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?
<br>
As the number required for the study is not sufficient, Beth could use the inductive reasoning to develop and test a theory (Miessler, 2018).  As the by=unber s

<b>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</b>
<br>
<b> Main areas.  </b>
<br>
- Introduce you to interview methods and survey methods.
<br>
- Consider the definitions of population and sample.
<br>
- Introduce the concept of pre- and post-testing.			
<br>	
<b> Reflective Activity 2</b>
<br>
Surveys are often useful to gauge the mood of a category of the population and to target a certain demographic. They provide valuable information that helps 
businesses and governments understand those they are serving.
<br>
However, surveys can also be used for hidden reasons often nefarious to manipulate public opinions and satisfy hidden agendas. The Cambridge Analytica survey 
scandal in 2018 is a flagrant example of a political scheme that used personal data to try and influence election campaigns and results (Boldyreva, 2018). 
<br>
Although innocuous at first, the survey was designed to collect personal information of Facebook users to influence the election campaign in the US. 
Personal data was collected not only from Facebook users who participated in the survey but also from their connections (friends and families) who took no part 
in the survey and were unaware of their personal being collected (Boldyreva, 2018).
<br>
The data collection method used was unique and consisted of using Amazon Mechanical Turk, (Amazon Mechanical Turk, 2018) to recruit Facebook users to take part 
in a paid online survey. However, in order to participate, users were required to connect their Facebook accounts to the survey site which enabled the site, 
not only to collect data on participating users but also on their contacts (friends and families). This technique proved to be very effective as 
Cambridge Analytica managed to collect up to 50 million personal data of Facebook users (Boldyreva, 2018).
<br>
A personality survey questionnaire similar to the one used by Cambridge Analytica is available at the University of Cambridge Psychometrics Centre 
(Discover My Profile, N.D.). The test when completed provides participants with an “OCEAN” score (Diener & Lucas, 2019). An “OCEAN” score is the 
result of the calculation of the performance of 5 personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism 
(Diener & Lucas, 2019).
<br>
Personality tests have been used since the 1960s by social behaviour scientists to determine the traits of participants, their happiness, and their longevity. 
As personality survey questions provide deep insights into participants’ psychological traits, it is important that they are explicitly informed of the intended use. 
<br>
Using this survey without informing users is professionally unethical as users’ consent was obtained on a false premise. 
<br>
On a social level, the survey may reveal traits that even the participants are not aware of. The result of these tests could be shared with other 3rd parties 
and used to develop psychological profiles on users who are directly identifiable due to access to their Facebook accounts.
<br>
From a legal perspective, the use of such surveys without user consent is in breach of the Data Protection Act (DPA) (Data Protection Act, 2018) 
and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (GDPR, 2018) which mandate users’ consent explicitly before their personal data is accessed. 
It must be noted that GDPR was rushed in to prevent future abuses of user personal data on this industrial scale.

I'll establish the objective of the survey by identifying each of the questions that need to be answered. I'll ensure the clarity of the questions, they are 
properly articulated, and free from bias.
<br>
I'll also be checking if it is possible to adapt an existing survey with a proven track record.
<br>
2- Design a methodology to collect data.
<br>
Next, I'll be designing a qualitative and quantitative methodology to measure the collected data.
<br>
3- Develop a survey format.
<br>
The questionnaire for the survey will be developed and posted on survey sites such as Surveyclircle and SurveyMonkey etc. The questionnaire will have both 
close-ended such as Yes/No, multiple choice, or scaled (for example 1 to 5 stars), and open-ended questions such as “Why?”, “How?,” and “What do you think?” and 
will be targeted at demographics such as young, old, male, female, etc.
<br>
4- Collect and analyze collected data.
As quantitative and qualitative survey results need to be analyzed in different ways, I'll be using different tools for each:
As an example, for quantitative data analysis, applications such as Microsoft Excel, google Sheets, etc. can be used to filter the data by different criteria and use their built-in formulas to visualize the results. 
The process is as follows: Filter, calculate, cross-tabulate, and draw conclusion.
