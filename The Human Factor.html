							<h2>Module Objective</h2>
							<p>This module offers an interdisciplinary perspective, involving Psychology, and Computer Science, 
							to equip students with the skills and knowledge to develop pragmatic methods to meet human factor cyber 
							security challenges.
							It helps students develop an understanding of the security issues and risks associated with how people 
							interact with computing systems and help them develop the knowledge and skills required to manage and 
							mitigate cyber risks in socio-technical systems.</p>
							<h2>Module Outcome</h2>
							
<p> The outcome of this module is to:
- Review of the concepts and principles of human behaviour within the context of cyber security.
- Development of an in-depth understanding of the elements of risk in a socio-technical system.
- Critical examination of effective strategies to promote and manage the human factor in cyber security.
- Critical evaluation of the social and ethical considerations in developing and applying usable security.
</p>
<p>
<b>Unit 1: Human Factors and Cyber Security</b> 
<br>
<b> Main areas  </b>
<br>
The Unit will touch on the following points:
<br>
- Exploration of human behaviour and its implications in designing computing systems within the context of cyber security.
<br>
- Discussion on human capabilities and limitations and their impact on usable security.
<br>
- Discussion on the concept of insider threat and accidental insider and their effect on security.

<br>
	
<b>Unit 2: Fitting the Task to the Human</b>
<b> Main areas  </b>
- Coverage of the four key principles to designing security to fit to humans.
- Identification of specific user groups and appropriate security design solution for such groups.
- Identification of available techniques and technologies to facilitate the design.
<br>
<b>Unit 3: Mental Models and Accessibility Issues</b>
<b> Main areas  </b>
- Exploration of the use of mental models in identifying user perceptions and security preferences.
- Coverage of the use of mental models as an approach to designing usable security.
- Review of the contextual design process and how they are applied to usable security.
- Discussion on the concept of accessibility and their implications.						
<br>
<b>Unit 4: Usable Security Design</b>
<b> Main areas  </b>
- Explore the various techniques to consider when planning a usable design solution.
- Discuss the strengths and weakness of the techniques and their application contexts.
- Apply the contextual design approach to a case study.			
</br>
<b>Unit 5: Ethical, Societal and Organisational Issues</b>
<b> Main areas.  </b>
- Discuss cultural, organisational issues and their impact on security.
- Discuss the framework to develop a positive, organisational security culture.
- Cover the use of mental model as security risk communication tool.
- Discuss the legal and ethical requirements and implication when developing usable security.
- Reflect on the current and future research in the various areas of usable security and human factors in cyber security.			
<br>
<b>Unit 6: Mental Models and Risk Communication</b>
<b> Main areas.  </b>
- Employment of mental models to understand user behaviours.
- Learning of how to use mental models to address specific human factor issues.
- Exploration of the use of metaphors as a technique to communicate risks.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
This module was very interesting as it shows some of the weaknesses of humans in terms of cybersecurity. Social engineering techniques that are used to gain trust and 
trick people to do things they would not otherwise do are good examples of the inherent weaknesses of humans in the digitalization age. It really proves that humans are 
the weakest links in the cybersecurity chain.
